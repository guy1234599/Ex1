# Ex1
    
In this assignment, we will design a number formatting converter and calculator. In general, we will use Strings as numbers over the base of binary till Hexa (2-16), 10-16 are represented by A,B,..G. The general representation of the numbers is as a String with the following format: <number><b><base>

## Table of Contents
### Ex1Main- 
this is where is the main function where all the imelemetion of the calculation and conversion functions from Ex1 and printing the demandeing for the input after the userr is done with typing on the input if the input is true the output will be print  

### Ex1Test-
this is where we input for the calculation and conversion functions to check if the work like how they supposed and by this tests we can improve our project.

### Ex1
this is where is the calculation and conversion functions that practical the calculation and conversion are done.

## True input 
The input should be a String that represnt number  in base between 2-16 the input could be just a number and that say the number in base 10 if the input is just a number it would be a positiv integer if the input is not just a numbr it should be in the formtion <number><b><base> number will be any positiv integer one or[A-F] the base should be in range [2-16] or [A-g] and b all time
wiil be b . no space is allowed 
when you asked to put a base alone the input also be like that [2-16] or [A-g]
## How to use
When the program start to run the user will see a print "Ex1 class solution " and in the next line "Enter a String as a number#1 or enter quit to end the program" the user should put a true input it can look in "True input" and then user is asked to do it again and after tht to type a base if the base in the range that was asked to program will print the sum of the to number in tha base
